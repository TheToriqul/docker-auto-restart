## üìã Overview

This project explores Docker‚Äôs automatic restart policies to ensure container resilience and uptime, even in cases of failure. Through this journey, I gained practical insights into Docker's restart management capabilities and the exponential backoff strategy for controlling restart timing. The primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with container reliability and failover techniques, which are essential for production environments.

## üèó Technical Architecture

Docker provides an array of restart policies to automatically manage container restarts:
- **Never Restart (default):** Containers will not restart on failure.
- **Restart on Failure:** Containers restart only when a failure is detected.
- **Restart for a Predetermined Time on Failure:** Containers restart for a set period after each failure.
- **Always Restart:** Containers restart regardless of the reason for stopping, illustrating the exponential backoff strategy.

Docker‚Äôs **exponential backoff strategy** progressively increases the delay between restart attempts to avoid constant restart loops. This helps prevent system strain by extending the wait time for each successive restart attempt.

## üíª Technical Stack

- **Containerization**: Docker
- **OS**: Ubuntu (reference container for testing)

## ‚≠ê Key Features

1. **Automatic Restart Policies**  
   Different policies for managing container restarts based on the reason for stopping.

2. **Exponential Backoff Strategy**  
   A progressive backoff period for each restart attempt (1s, 2s, 4s, etc.), preventing continuous restart loops and reducing potential system impact.

3. **Live Monitoring and Logging**  
   Commands to monitor container state and review logs to understand restart behavior and timing.

4. **Limitations and Advanced Control**  
   Observations on limitations during backoff periods, including restrictions on running commands in a container while it's restarting.

5. **Advanced Strategies for Production**  
   Suggestions for using init or supervisor processes to improve control over container restart behavior in production environments.

<summary>View Installation Details</summary>

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
- **Busybox**: Used for simple container operations.

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TheToriqul/docker-auto-restart.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd docker-auto-restart
    ```
3. Review and run Docker commands as outlined in the `scripts.sh` file.

## üìñ Usage Guide

<details>
<summary>View Usage Details</summary>

### Basic Usage

Run the following command to start a container with the `always` restart policy:

```bash
docker run -d --name backoff-detector --restart always busybox date
```

### Monitoring Restarts

Use this command to follow the container logs and observe the exponential backoff restart timings:

```bash
docker logs -f backoff-detector
```

### Limitations

During backoff periods, the container is in a "restarting" state, which prevents execution of `docker exec` commands. Attempting to do so will result in an error:

```bash
docker exec backoff-detector echo "Test"
```
